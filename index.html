                    <p>Many of the projects undertaken in the information technology industry today and over the past several years, are related to security threats. It is timely since the number of threats have increased substantially in recent years. Delloitte (2015), as cited by the Apex Informatics, reports that one billion records were compromised as a result of security breaches in 2014, and the cost per compromise is estimated at $57-$82 US dollars. Protection of data has of greatest importance to organizations. One example is the case of Sony, wherein information about 50,000 employees was revealed due to a hacking incident. This situation have raised awareness within organizations of the importance of prioritizing this serious threat.

                    <p>Cloud projects were unheard of in 2000, but today they are commonplace. According to Investopedia, cloud computing refers to the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. This technological advancement has made a huge difference to organizations in being able to save money by paying for server space in the cloud, rather than making expensive capital expenditures on expensive datacenters, and there have been a massive number of projects in this area.

                    <p>There are an increasing number of people who are opting to go the freelance route instead of following the traditional model of having one boss and one job to do. This has been made entirely possible by the advancements made in technology that have opened up both workers and clients to the global marketplace. Therefore, organizations can choose to hire top-tier talent from all around the world and are no longer limited to those who are local.   Indeed, major companies such as Buffer have embraced this and started hiring remote full-time workers. Through communication tools such as Skype and Slack, people can get their work done as if they were in a physical office building. Meetups are held a few times a year so that employees can establish a face-to-face connection and strengthen their working relationship. Overall, work flexibility is being embraced, and it will be far more commonplace in the IT industry than the traditional setup where workers report to the same physical location every day.

                    <p>Because technology is advancing at such a rapid pace, many consumers may feel left behind. They might restrain themselves from using a product on the simple notion that it is too complicated for them to use as they see fit. Take a look at Apple’s Mac operating system as an example.   One of the reasons why you see many workers switching from Windows to Mac is due to the ease with which you can use their operating system. Even though it can handle most of the same complexities as other operating systems, it is easy to learn how to use it for casual computing purposes. The tutorials are simple, and most people report that it eventually feels intuitive to use the Mac.   How does this relate to workers in the IT industry? Those developing IT products will be forced to examine their application design critically and put themselves in the shoes of their ideal demographic. Simplicity will be the key focus, and any inefficiencies in the form of unnecessary complexity will have to be removed.   In a world that is running at breakneck speeds, consumers won’t have the time to sit down for hours and learn how to use a product. The learning curve needs to be made as small as possible. Expect to see a “pick up n’ play” mentality being adopted when the user interface is being optimized for the customer

                    <p>3D printing refers to processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together). 3D printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing (AM). Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file (usually in sequential layers). There are many different technologies, like stereolithography (STL) or fused deposit modeling (FDM). Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file, usually by successively adding material layer by layer.
					One of the biggest game changes in the manufacturing industry for all sectors has been the invention and development of 3D printing. It sounds like a dream come true – you send a digital 3D design to a printer, and it will recreate that entire thing. With printing speed improving and the cost of printing becoming cheaper, it will be the most valuable tool for any company that regularly manufactures and ships IT products. Customizations in design will become far easier, and less human supervision will be required.

Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
					These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do. Many of today’s robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.

Many of its users suffered serious life-altering consequences because of this breach, and the damage has clearly been done. What’s to say that this same kind of hacking event couldn’t happen in other industries where data protection is the #1 concern?   IT companies will be forced to employ maximum security measures as they continue to develop the latest technologies. Systems will have to be continually tested, and knowledge gaps will have to be filled in order to stay one step ahead of those who have malicious intent. Expect the standards for cyber security, both from consumers and workers, to rise sharply with each passing year.

                    <p>Biometrics is the measurement and statistical analysis of people’s unique physical and behavioral characteristics. The technology is mainly used for identification and access control, or for identifying individuals who are under surveillance. The basic premise of biometric authentication is that every person can be accurately identified by his or her intrinsic physical or behavioral traits.
					The two main types of biometric identifiers depend on either physiological characteristics or behavioral characteristics. Physiological identifiers relate to the composition of the user being authenticated and include facial recognition, fingerprints, finger geometry (the size and position of fingers), iris recognition, vein recognition, retina scanning, voice recognition and DNA matching. Behavioral identifiers, on the other hand, include the unique ways in which individuals act, including recognition of typing patterns, walking gait and other gestures. Some of these behavioral identifiers can be used to provide continuous authentication instead of a single one-off authentication check.

                        <p>
                        Developing new plans and schemes against cybercrime is still an ongoing challenge for IT professionals. Cyber-criminals quickly adapt to new technologies making all industries vulnerable to their attacks. Increase in number of new users online is also a reason why security is still an issue today especially in countries with weak cybersecurity. McAfee, a famous antivirus software, reported that “monetization of stolen data, which has always been a problem for cyber-criminals, seems to have become less difficult because of improvements in cyber-crime black markets and the use of digital currencies.”

                        Technology advances rapidly and shows up in media on all sides. This means users, managers at all levels, and even competitors pressure IT staff to implement new technology, simply because it is new. The real challenge is deciding which of these new technologies will work to the best interest of advancing the organization, and which are better to avoid for now. In a study conducted by Gartner data, about two of three business leaders think their companies need to quickly do their digital transformation to avoid losing to its competitors.

                         Many organizations have yet to shift to using cloud storage. They still choose to keep their data and applications in-house and manage everything themselves. With the advancements in cloud computing technologies and to future-proof the network, preparing the organization for a potential cloud move is common sense.

                        Data is predicted to grow by 800 percent in the next five years, but the huge challenge is that more than 80 percent of this is unstructured. Unstructured data varies in its formats, including plain text, email, blog, formatted document, standard and non-standard image, video, voice, animation, sensor input and web search logs. Unstructured data is growing faster than structured data and it has potential to reveal more important information that were very hard to determine before.

                        <p>
                        For years, IT has controlled user's devices – but with the advent of smartphones and tablets, that has changed. Users now bring in their own devices (BYOD) without IT's knowledge. They use them for both personal and work-related tasks. IT's initial plan was to attempt to maintain control. The facts are clear: Controlling user-owned devices in an organization's network is nearly impossible.

                    <p>
						When a user brings their own device, they will also bring their own applications (BYOA) that they have been accustomed to. That is a plus for productivity and a challenge for IT security. IT managers and CIOs will need to decide what to secure: the network infrastructure or the organization's data.

In some cases, it has become increasingly difficult to draw the line between them. Tablets and smartphones already perform many tasks previously completed by desktops. That means organizations must adapt to multiple user systems. These days, internal users and customers may access organizational data and applications via many different methods depending on their current location.

At this rate, a savings of just a few percent can make a big difference to an IT budget. With an increasing trend of expanding green initiatives and alternate sources of energy, organizations are working on ways to improve energy monitoring and efficiency.

                        Value Creation is a recurring IT issue. It's now a priority. IT departments must focus on improving service to the organizational user and to the organization's departmental needs. To do so, IT managers must remove any non-essential activities that are in the way. This leads to businesses moving as many services to the cloud as possible. By doing this, owning and maintaining software and hardware will be reduced creating more profit and revenue to the industry.

                        Conventional offices seem less relevant when digital technologies, such as email, instant messaging and video conferencing, enable employees to work remotely. It results to IT professionals facing greater pressure to keep networks running at top capacity. Accountability is an issue, since workers and supervisors are scattered across different nations or time zones. The absence of formal schedules also means less separation between life and work than ever, with IT managers increasingly expected to troubleshoot problems at unusual hours.

                        It was estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that demand for IT jobs will grow approximately 15 percent between 2012 and 2022 -- 11 percent faster than the estimated average for all other occupations. Demand for specialized areas like cybersecurity sparks fierce bidding wars that favor the largest firms. For instance, Forbes reported in 2011 that Google raised their managers' salaries by 10 percent to prevent defections to rivals like Facebook. This trend leaves smaller firms and industries struggling to recruit talent while industry leaders like Google continually replace top performers who often jump ship for better offers.
